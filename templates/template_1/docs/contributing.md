Get Started!
------------

Ready to contribute? Here's how to set up `{{ cookiecutter.project_slug }}` for local development.

1. Fork the `{{ cookiecutter.project_slug }}` repo on GitHub.
2. Clone your fork locally::

    $ git clone git@github.com:your_name_here/{{ cookiecutter.project_slug }}.git

3. Install your local copy into a virtualenv. Assuming you have virtualenvwrapper installed, this is how you set up your fork for local development::
#TODO SS  poetry

4. Create a branch for local development::

    $ git checkout -b name-of-your-bugfix-or-feature

   Now you can make your changes locally.

5. When you're done making changes, check that your changes pass flake8 and the
   tests, including testing other Python versions with tox::

    $ flake8 {{ cookiecutter.project_slug }} tests
    $ black .
    $ python setup.py test or pytest

   To get flake8 and tox, just pip install them into your virtualenv.

6. Commit your changes and push your branch to GitHub::

    $ git add .
    $ git commit -m "Your detailed description of your changes."
    $ git push origin name-of-your-bugfix-or-feature

7. Submit a pull request through the GitHub website.
